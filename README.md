<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a very simple chat app that allows multiple users to chat in chat rooms.

General usage of this app:
* User first enter a join page to provide a user name and a chat room to enter
* The server will redirect the user to their corresponding chat room
* User can then send text messages, images, or share their location in the chat

Each chat room has a profanity message filter, so no bad words are allowed :)
